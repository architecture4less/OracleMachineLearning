# OracleMachineLearning

This is my personal project submission for professor Vanselow's _COP3003: Object Oriented Programming_ class at Florida Gulf Coast University for the 2019 fall semester. I will be completing the [Artificial Intelligence with Machine Learning in Java](https://academy.oracle.com/en/solutions-curriculum-full.html#machinelearn) Oracle iLearning course.

## Week 1
> **Sunday, Sep 22nd, 2019**

- [X] Complete Section 1 - Introduction.
  > This week covered basic vocabulary and concepts related to AI and ML.

- 1-1 Course Overview
  - [X] Understand the nature of the course
  - [X] Understand the delivery mechanism

- 1-2 Introduction to AI
  - [X] Define artificial intelligence
    > AI is the ability for a machine to exhibit human-like intelligence. This can be evaluated through a Turing test. The appearance of intelligence can be due to the performance of an algorithm with immense processing power rather than the mimicking of human behavior.
  - [X] Define machine learning
    > The Stanford University definition of Machine Learning is "The science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed". ML is a potential approach to building an AI. ML algorithms are focused on making predictions on data sets.
  - [x] Give examples of using artificial intelligence
    > AI and ML are used today in facial recognition, speech recognition, image categorization, targeted advertising, content suggestion, etc.
  - [x] Define data exhaust
    > Data exhaust refers to the data that we create as we go about our day, which can potentially be collected.
  
- 1-3 Data and Information
  - [X] Define data
    > Data are the raw, unprocessed facts about the world.
  - [X] Define information
    > Information is the useful and contextualized presentation of data.  
  - [X] Differentiate between data and information
  
- 1-4 Categorizing Data
  - [X] Define supervised learning
    > A labeled set of inputs (independent data) and expected outputs (dependent data) are given to the computer to learn from. 
  - [X] Define unsupervised learning
    > The set of training data is unstructured, meaning it has not been labelled and the relationships of the data are not known. This can be the result of extremely large data sets.
  - [x] Define classification
    > Input data is defined in terms of discrete values or 'class labels'.
  - [x] Define regression
    > Input data is defined over a continuous range, using real numbers.
  - [x] Define structured and unstructured data
    > Structured data is highly organized and tabular, with little complexity. Examples are numbers, dates, and names. Unstructured data can be complex, including things such as emails, objects in a photograph, etc.

## Week 2
> **Sunday, Sep 29th, 2019**

- [X] Complete Section 2 – Machine Learning
  > This week examined the forces behind ML's adoption and its implementation.

- 2-1 Why Now?
  - [X] State the reasons behind the growth in AI
    > Modern, technology-rich life creates bountiful data exhaust that can be turned into useful information. Companies are interested in this information to make better decisions within their market. Machine learning takes advantage of modern processing power and resources such as the cloud to provide companies with algorithms that allow them to analyze data to make rapid and strategic decisions.
  - [X] Understand the growth in processing power
    > The growth in processing power can be summarized by Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years, due to innovation and falling costs. This phenomena was first written about by Gordon Moore in 1965, and has proved accurate in prior decades. In the 2010's, however, the rate began to decelerate, down to every two-or-three years. Some experts believe Moore's Law could fail completely by 2025.  

- 2-2 Machine Learning Workflow
  - [X] Understand the use of models within machine learning
    > A project that utilizes ML for its solution uses a workflow model (such as CRISP-DM) to stick to a defined processes and keep a specific goal in mind.
  - [X] Understand the CRISP-DM Model
    > 1. Business Understanding (what questions need to be answered?) 2. Data Understanding (where will the data originate?) 3. Data Preparation (what data is required and in what format?) 4. Modelling (what ML algorithm will be used?) 5. Evaluation (how accurate were the results?) 6. Deployment (push out the solution)
